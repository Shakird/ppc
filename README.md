<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<h3 align="center">Before letting you loose there are a few things we have to do to set you up for success.</h3>

### Prerequisites

A few essentials to install that will ensure your development experience with this project goes smoothly.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Docker
  ```sh
  https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shakird/project-purple-cow.git
   ```
2. Install npm packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
   <!-- Docker-compose-->
## üê≥ Docker-compose Quick start ‚ö°Ô∏è

### `pull`
The `pull` command pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml or docker-stack.yml file, but does not start containers based on those images.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
```

### `up`
The `up` command aggregates the output of each container. When the command exits, all containers are stopped. Running `docker-compose up -d` starts the containers in the background and leaves them running.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### `down`
The `down` command stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

<!-- Commands & Options-->
## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands & Options

### `start`
Thanks to Docker this runs automatically. However, hiccups are possible. For those rare occasions heres the rundown. This runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of a package's "scripts" object. For you that means that the `start` command will run the following command: `react-scripts start`.
```bash
npm start
```
